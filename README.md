Names: Zeeshawn Ahmad, Hannah Johnston, Samira Koraganie, Shamariah Ogu, William Micknick

## Introduction
Our project is called NovelNook. It is a new way for users to discover books! 
## Description of the Project
Finding books can be a hard process for readers. Readers don't want to waste their time and/or their money reading a book they don't enjoy. To solve this issue we decided to develop a web application to show readers books in a fast and simple way. <br>
Using a random book generator from the Open Library API we show book previews to our users. NovelNook suggests books to readers based on books they have "liked". This minimizes the stress of manually searching for a new book to read and helps find books the user will enjoy. <br>
We have utilized JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Supabase, API's and more to make NovelNook possible.
## Description of Target Browsers
This web app can be used on a variety of browsers to increase target audience. As we were developing we used Google Chrome to develop the app, but it works on mobile browsers as well.
