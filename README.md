Names: Zeeshawn Ahmad, Hannah Johnston, Samira Koraganie, Shamariah Ogu, William Micknick

## Introduction
Our project is called NovelNook. It is a new way for users to discover books! 
## Description of the Project
Finding books can be a hard process for readers. Readers don't want to waste their time and/or their money reading a book they don't enjoy. To solve this issue we decided to develop a web application to show readers books in a fast and simple way. <br>
Using a random book generator from the Open Library API we show book previews to our users. NovelNook suggests books to readers based on books they have "liked". This minimizes the stress of manually searching for a new book to read and helps find books the user will enjoy. <br>
We have utilized JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Supabase, API's and more to make NovelNook possible.
## Description of Target Browsers
This web app can be used on a variety of browsers to increase target audience. As we were developing we used Google Chrome to develop the app, but it works on mobile browsers as well. 
## Developer Manual
### Installation of NovelNook Application
Completed web application is linked [here]().
<br>
To install the application for further development purposes, it's files are all hosted on this Github link found [here](https://github.com/zahmad12terp/novelNook). 
<br><br>
Note for the Grading Team: The development team originally worked on [this repository](https://github.com/sssmira/377). Which explains why there are less contributions in the final Github repository, we needed to switch repos for purposes relating to hosting on Vercel. 
<br><br>
Clone the Github repository to your workspace to edit, we developed using VScode but other code editors may work as well. To run the application for viewing while editing, we opened the HTML files using our web browser (Chrome), similar web browsers may be used. Additionally, for the front-end we used NodeJS, which required a 
download for npm linked [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
<br><br>
All of our web pages files are found in the 'public' sub-folder. <br>
 All of our NodeJS related modules are found in the 'node_modules' sub-folder (This folder can be ignored for editing purposes for the most part). <br>
 The '.vscode' sub-folder has a json file for the live server which isn't necessary in editing the web app. <br>
 Outside of the sub-folders, in the main NovelNook folder are a few JavaScript and JSON files <Someone edit this to further explain what these files do>.
